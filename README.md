# Super League - Level 1 Challenge


## Chasing the Clicks

This challenge is to build a web page with a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0.
It also shows on the web page the distribution of clicks by geography(U.S State) on a table.
